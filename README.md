# Box Custom Portal Demo with Auth0 Authentication

This repository hosts a demo showcasing how to create a custom portal using Box Platform APIs, Box UI Elements, React, Tailwind CSS, Vercel, and Auth0. This code repository goes along with this blog post. See that post for setup instructions. 

Find a live working demo of the portal here. 

## ⚠️ Important Notice

This demo is for demonstration purposes only and is not production-ready. It lacks complete authentication measures, making it unsuitable for live environments without further development. Please do your own due dilegence and code reviews.
